## Overview
This project involves creating a sortable list component with up to five skills the user can add through input boxes or by clicking on items in a pre-defined list of IT skills. While typing in an input box a pop-up window appears with a dinamic list of further suggestions to chose from. The added skills' order can be changed and they can be deleted or new ones added any time.

### The challenge

About the component:

- The component should display a list of up to 5 selected skills in a column.
- If the list doesn't have all 5 selected skills, the component should display an input box just after the last selected skill in the list.
- The input box should display suggestions as the user types from an API or hard-coded data.
- After selecting a skill from the suggestions, the selected skill should be added to the list of selected skills.
- The component should allow the user to delete a selected skill by clicking on a delete button.
- The component should allow the user to rearrange the selected skills by drag and drop.
- The component should also display a column of suggested skills next to the list.
- The user should be able to select a skill from the suggested skills column and add it directly to the list by clicking on the skill.
- Show the hover state of all the elements.
- The component should be responsive and display correctly on different screen sizes.
- Make this landing page look as close to the design as possible.

### What I learned

This project gave me the opportunity to write clean, well-structured code and to implement each feature in a clear and organized way. I also learned how to design event listeners so that they work independently without interfering with one another.
